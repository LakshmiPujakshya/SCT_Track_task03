ðŸ§  Decision Tree Classifier â€” Bank Marketing Dataset
This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a Decision Tree Classifier using the Bank Marketing dataset. The goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on various customer attributes.

ðŸ“Œ Requirements
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
ðŸš€ How to Run the Notebook
Open a terminal or Anaconda prompt.

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook
Open the decision_tree_bank_marketing.ipynb notebook.

Run all cells sequentially to:

Load and explore the dataset

Preprocess data (handle missing values, encode categorical variables, etc.)

Split the dataset into training and testing sets

Train a Decision Tree Classifier

Evaluate the model (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)

Visualize the decision tree (optional)

ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview
(Update this based on actual features used in the notebook)

Common features used in the Bank Marketing dataset:

Age

Job

Marital Status

Education

Default

Balance

Housing Loan

Duration

Campaign

Poutcome

Target Variable:
y â€” whether the client has subscribed to a term deposit (yes or no)

ðŸ§  Model Details
Model Used: DecisionTreeClassifier from scikit-learn

Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy

Precision / Recall / F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

Optional:

Plot of the decision tree using plot_tree or graphviz
